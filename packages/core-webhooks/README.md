# @connectors/core-webhooks (deprecated)

Deprecated webhook processor superseded by `@connectors/core-runtime`.

Status:
- Retained only for backward compatibility with legacy adapter-express tests.
- Removal planned for v1.0.0; do not add new usages.

Use `core-runtime` webhook handlers and deduplication instead of this package.
